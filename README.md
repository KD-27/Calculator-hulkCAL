1. The code defines a class `MainApp` that inherits from the `App` class provided by the Kivy framework.

2. The `build()` method is overridden to construct the user interface of the application.

3. The `operators` list stores the arithmetic operators used in the calculator.

4. The `last_was_operator` variable keeps track of whether the last button pressed was an operator.

5. The `last_button` variable stores the value of the last button pressed.

6. The main layout of the application is created as a vertical `BoxLayout`.

7. A `TextInput` widget called `solution` is created to display the calculator input and output.

8. Buttons are created using nested lists that define their labels. Each button is bound to the `on_button_press` method when pressed.

9. The `on_button_press` method is called when a button is pressed. It handles the logic for appending button labels to the text input field, handling operators and clear button.

10. The `on_solution` method is called when the "=" button is pressed. It evaluates the expression entered in the text input field using the `eval` function and displays the result in the text input field.

11. In the `__main__` block, an instance of the `MainApp` class is created, and the `run()` method is called to start the application.

12. The application launches and the user can interact with the calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
